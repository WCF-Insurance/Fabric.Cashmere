    <!-- *hcPickerItem="let item" is very similar to an *ngFor="let item of items" in that it specifies what this template will refer to the context object as for each iteration of the yet to be provided list.
    The difference with *ngFor is that we don't specify the list of items as that is handled by the <hc-multi-select-component> and the html below this comment is really just a template that <hc-multi-select-component> stamps out for every selectedValues and nonSelectedValues.-->
    <div *hcPickerItem="let item"><!-- This allows referencing an item that has yet to be provided to be used in the template -->
        <!--        <ng-template let-multiSelectItem="multiSelectItem">Checked: {{multiSelectItem.checked}}</ng-template>-->
